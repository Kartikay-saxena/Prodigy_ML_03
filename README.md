# Prodigy_ML_03
Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

Decision Tree Classifier with Visualization

This repository contains my implementation for Task 03 of the Prodigy InfoTech 
Machine Learning Internship. The goal of this task was to build a Decision Tree 
model and visualize how it splits the data.

I used a clean classification dataset and trained a Decision Tree classifier, 
tuned a few hyperparameters, and visualized the tree structure to understand the 
splitting logic.
